A candy business, which ships all kinds of candy around the world!
It's color scheme is a trid of cyan, megenta, and yellow (like cmyk).

The reasons for the colors chosen:
    1. These shades of Magenta, Cyan, and Yellow feel like colors that would be associated with candies.
    2. The Magenta is often associated with creativity, something a Candy shop embodies
    3. Cyan symbolizes clarity and serenty, both align with Carl's Candy's policy of candy being for all ages, even older folks.
    4. The Yellow embodies Happiness and Excitement, both of which are plentiful in a Candy Shop.

The triad scheme was chosen because it gave three colors that were not only visually appealing with each other, but also looked like common candy colors.

The specific colors are: #F50076, #14D7F5, #F5DC14
There are also additional shades used depending on the situation: #CD77A0, #446E75, #DBCC5A

I got these colors through the Adobe Colors color wheel.
