A pumpkin patch's website. The pumpkin patch's name is Polly's Pumpkin Patch.
The color scheme for this one is analogous. I chose various versions of orange and red-orange for few reasons:
    1. Orange is the primary color of most pumpkins.
    2. Orange envokes a feeling of a youthfull optimism and happiness, perfect for a place where people of all ages can partake in the Halloween and Fall Fun.
    3. Similarly, Red-Orange envokes a feeling of bright and youthful energy, once again, perfect for a Pumpkin Patch.

I got these colors through the Adobe Colors color wheel.
